				<h3>What are E-Savers?</h3>

				<p>E-Savers are small rubbery pieces that have highly advanced sensory technology that are put inside the outlet. Their advance sensors allow them to detect when products are not in use and cut off the electricity transmittance. 

				<p>E-Savers product doesn't detect or simply reduce electricity it stops electricity from being overused. In addition, my product is affordable and easily assessable. Every year Billions of dollars are wasted on electrity. Our goal is to help reduce that number.
